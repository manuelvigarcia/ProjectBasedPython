### Online python interpreters
These are the URLs for the three online interpreters suggested in section 1 lecture 5
 * http://pythonfiddle.com/ (no https)
 * https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compilers/online-python-compiler.htm (changed from the lecture recording)
 * The third does not work, so I'm providing https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_compiler.asp and https://www.online-python.com/
